# Connecting The Good Cloud

## OS environment variables
We recommend to set the following OS environment variables:
- `RIBASIM_NL_CLOUD_PASS`: password for the cloud, to be requested at Deltares
- `RIBASIM_NL_DATA_DIR`: directory with your local copy of data in the Ribasim-NL cloud

## Initialize the cloud
Import the `Cloud`` and initialize it
```
from ribasim_nl import CloudStorage
```

If you have set OS environment variables:
```
cloud_store = CloudStorage()
```

And else
```
cloud_storage = CloudStorage(password=password, data_dir=my_data_dir)
```

## Download sources (basisgegevens)
Find all sources

```
# find all sources, `PBL_watertypenkaart`
sources = cloud_storage.source_data
# download, `PBL_watertypenkaart`
cloud.download_basisgegevens(bronnen=["PBL_watertypenkaart"])
```

## Find water authorities
To find available water authorities:
```
cloud_storage.water_authorities
```

## Download water authority datasets
```
authority = "Rijkswaterstaat"

# to download external data (aangeleverd) only
cloud_storage.download_aangeleverd(authority)

# to download manipulated data (verwerkt) only
cloud_storage.download_verwerkt(authority)

# to download all
cloud_storage.download_all(authority)
```

## Upload manipulated data (aangeleverd)
```
authority = "Rijkswaterstaat"
# upload local `aangeleverd` directory to cloud-storage
cloud_storage.upload_aangeleverd(authority, overwrite=True)
```

## Upload models
```
authority = "Rijkswaterstaat"
cloud_storage.uploaded_models(authority) # to see which models have been uploaded

cloud_storage.upload_model(authority, model="ijsselmeer") # to upload a new version of the `ijsselmeermodel`.
```
