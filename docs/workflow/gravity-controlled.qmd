title: "Gravity controlled"
---

Workflow for deriving and parametizing "gravity controlled systems". They include 11 water authorities on the Eastern side of The Neterlands for which initial datasets have been prepared by SWECO.
You need code in [`src/ribasim_nl`](https://github.com/Deltares/Ribasim-NL/tree/main/src/ribasim_nl).

Under `notebooks` you'll find 3 scrips per water authority, e.g. `notebooks\aa_en_maas`, you can run in sequence.

1. `01_fix_model.py` will "fix" the GIS-models supplied by Sweco in the directories `{authority}_2024_6_3` to valid Ribasim-models in the directory `{authority}_fix_model`
2. `02_prepare_model.py`will read `{authority}_fix_model` and add `levels` and `flow_rate` to the model and a `static_data.xlsx` that can be reviewed. The model will be written as `{authority}_prepare_model`
3. `03_parameterized_model.py` will read `{authority}_prepare_model` and `static_data.xlsx` to a model `{authority}_parameterized_model`
